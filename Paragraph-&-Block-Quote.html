        <h3>Telangna state bird</h3>
        <P>Due to its legendary significance, the Palapitta, or Indian Roller, is the state bird of Telangana. According to Hindu mythology, seeing this bird on Dussehra or before any task paves the way to success. This idea is supported by the fact that Lord Ram noticed the Indian roller before attacking Lanka and triumphing. The bird was designated as Telangana's state symbol and is now regarded as a lucky omen.</P>
